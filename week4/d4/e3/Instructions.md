# Print Years Using For Loop

## Objective
Learn how to use the `for` loop in Java to iterate and print a string along with a sequence of years.

## Instructions

**Print Years Using For Loop**

In this project, you will write a small program that prints the string "Hey, it is year:" followed by the years from 2025 to 2030 (inclusive).

**For you to do:**

1. **Initialize the Loop**
   - Use a `for` loop that starts with the variable `year` initialized to 2025.

2. **Use the For Loop to Print the String and Year**
   - Inside the loop, print "Hey, it is year:".
   - Print the value of `year`.
   - Ensure the loop continues as long as `year` is less than or equal to 2030.
   - Increment `year` by 1 each iteration.

## Expected Output
```
Hey, it is year:
2025
Hey, it is year:
2026
Hey, it is year:
2027
Hey, it is year:
2028
Hey, it is year:
2029
Hey, it is year:
2030
```

## Tips
- Ensure your `for` loop has the correct condition to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to increment the `year` variable by 1 in each iteration so that the loop terminates correctly.

## Additional Information
- **For Loop**: A `for` loop in Java combines initialization, condition-checking, and updating in a single line, making it ideal for tasks where the number of iterations is predetermined.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, verify that the loop condition and the increment operation are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the `for` loop in Java to print a series of years. Happy coding!

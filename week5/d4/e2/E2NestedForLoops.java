         *    - Use a for loop that runs 2 times. This will control the number of full pattern blocks.
         *    - Think of each iteration of this loop as creating one section of your banner.
         *
         * 2. Inside the Outer Loop:
         *    - First, print the string "SDLC" using System.out.println(). This prints "SDLC" on its own line.
         *
         * 3. Inner Loop:
         *    - Within the outer loop, use another for loop that runs 3 times.
         *    - This inner loop will print the word "Java" on a new line each time.
         *
         * 4. New Lines:
         *    - Use System.out.println() to ensure each word is printed on a separate line.
